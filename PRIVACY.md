# Privacy Policy

Last updated: Dec 31, 2025

## Overview

This application does not collect or store personal data on our servers. All required information is stored locally on-device.

## Data Collection

No user data is stored remotely. All core functionality runs locally.

We use **Google Analytics** to collect **anonymous, aggregated usage data** (such as page views or feature usage) to help understand how the app is used and improve it.

This analytics data does not include personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

Google Analytics may use cookies or similar technologies to generate anonymous statistics. You can disable cookies in your browser if you wish.

## Future Developments

Cloud functionality may be added in the future (e.g. syncing hidden comments across devices), but this functionality will be opt-in. If introduced, this policy will be updated to clearly explain what data is involved and how it is used.

## Third Parties

We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Google Analytics data is handled according to Google’s own privacy policy.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new “Last updated” date.
