**Adds the functionality to YouTube Studio to Mark a comment as Read, which hides it from comments listings.**

With the default Response Status: Unresponded filter in YouTube Studio, comments only leave the Community tab or the video's Comments page when they are replied to or reacted to with a Heart. This means that the screen can get increasingly cluttered if there are a lot of comments that don't warrant a direct response. YouTube Mark Read allows you to mark comments as Read, which hides them from all comments feeds in YouTube Studio, unless you restore them. 

You can also choose to display hidden comments with a blur overlay that fades on hover, to make sure you didn't accidentally mark any comments you wanted to respond to. The extension also has a popup which allows you to restore the most recent hidden comment, or all comments within a specified date range.
